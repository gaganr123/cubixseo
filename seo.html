            <p>
              Search engine optimization is more commonly known as its acronym
              SEO. Optimization is the basis of all SEO practices. You can
              increase your online visibility, once your brand's presence in
              website and its content and social media platforms are optimized
              across the internet. Your website will find its way to the first
              page of the search engine results pages (SERPs). Your online
              customers will find your business much quicker too.

              <p>
                SEO is the practice of making changes to your website for making
                it more attractive to search engines like Google and Bing. The
                best SEO practices make sure it is easy for search engines to
                understand your website. SEO increases the quantity of organic
                website traffic and the quality of your site visitors at no
                additional cost. It doesn't include any paid media or placement
                and it excludes direct traffic. With a robust SEO strategy
                implemented on your website, Google will identify it as an
                authority site and direct users in your site's direction.
